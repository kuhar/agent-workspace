# Update Marks

## Overview

Add key locations from the most recent task to the `marks.md` file.

## Steps

1. **Identify key locations from the recent task**
   - Files you read that contained important context
   - Code you wrote or modified (especially new functions/classes)
   - Entry points, utilities, or architectural boundaries you discovered

2. **Check for existing marks.md**
   - If `marks.md` exists in workspace root, read it first
   - Avoid adding duplicates

3. **Write marks**
   - Use `@symbol` prefix for function/class definitions
   - Use descriptive names for conceptual marks
   - Group related marks with `# Section` comments
   - Append new marks to the file (or create it if missing)

4. **Show the user what was added**
   - List the new marks you added
